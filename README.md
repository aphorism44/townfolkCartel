# The Townsfolk Cartel

This is an idle game, and the first game I made using the Phaser.io engine. You can play it online here: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/687176.

It's very simple and short (you can win in about 35 minutes). While programming it, I realized that I didn't care for "traditional" idle games, simply because there's better things to do than letting a game run for days on end. So, I added both an opening and ending scene.

I got a lot of laughs over the game's concept. In old-school RPGs, adventurers generally grind by killing monsters and gathering treasure. However, when they come to town, the prices don't change - the inn costs the same low price, even if you're a millionaire. Now, if you run an inn (or tavern, or healing temple, etc.), and if you're the only town in the area, you pretty much own the adventurers. So, why don't town dwellers not rip off adventurers as much as possible?

Surprisingly, this game did well on Newgrounds. Additionally, I created my first plugin, so I can do a little open-source programming for Phaser.
